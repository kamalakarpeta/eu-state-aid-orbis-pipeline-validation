# Automated Data Pipeline for Grant Data Integration

**Description:**

This project involves the development of an automated data pipeline to integrate grant data from a public source into a data platform. The pipeline incorporates data extraction, transformation, validation, and loading processes to ensure data quality and enhance the information available within the platform. This project showcases the implementation of robust data engineering practices to improve data accuracy and team efficiency.

**Project Overview:**

This project streamlines the extraction, processing, and integration of grant data. The key components are:

1.  **Automated Data Extraction:**
    * Automates the extraction of data from a public website using web automation techniques.
    * Handles form submissions and website changes to ensure reliable data extraction.
2.  **Data Storage & Transfer:**
    * Stores the extracted data in a temporary storage location.
    * Automates the transfer of data to a cloud-based storage system.
3.  **Cloud-Based Storage:**
    * Utilizes cloud storage for scalable and reliable storage of raw data.
4.  **Cloud-Based Data Processing:**
    * Processes data in a cloud-based distributed computing environment.
    * Performs data cleaning, transformation, and matching.
    * Enriches data with information from an existing data source.
5.  **Database Integration:**
    * Loads the processed data into a database.
    * Maintains data integrity and updates information.
6.  **Data Validation:**
    * Implements data validation to identify and rectify discrepancies.
    * Defines expectations, runs checks, and generates quality reports.
7.  **Data Profiling:**
    * Profiles data to identify issues like missing values and inconsistencies.
8.  **Standardized Data Ingestion Template:**
    * Streamlines ingestion processes for consistency and efficiency.
9.  **Data Lineage Tracking:**
    * Tracks data transformations for integrity and traceability.
10. **Data Visualization:**
    * Visualizes integrated data for analysis.
